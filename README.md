# Udacity DAND Tableau: Baseball Data Visualizations

## Background:
The objective of this project was to explore a dataset and create a set of visulizations that tells a story or highlights trends within the data. My chosen dataset was curated by Udacity and involved baseball. 

## Description: 
A data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.

## Goal:
Create a visualization that shows differences among the performance of the baseball players
* Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
* Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
* Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau
